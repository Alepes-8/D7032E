## Home Exam

This code is done for a home exam, where you will rewrite code following good practises. The code base were given to us by our teacher at LTU, Josef Hallberg. 
The author is Alex Peschel.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.


## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
